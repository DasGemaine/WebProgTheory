    <h5> In Japan</h5>
    <p>Kappa (Japanese: 河童 or かっぱ, meaning "River child") are aquatic reptilian humanoids who inhabit the rivers and streams found all over Japan. Clumsy on land, they are at home in the water, where they thrive during the warm months. They are excellent swimmers, and despite their small size they are physically stronger than a grown man.</p>
